# Website with Navigation, Table, Links, and Form

This project is a basic website built using HTML5. It demonstrates how to create a navigational system, tables, image-based links, and a contact form. The website consists of three main pages and includes various features, such as a table to display courses and a form to collect user input.

## Features

1. **Navigation Bar**:
   - A navigation menu is included at the top of each page.
   - The current page link is highlighted to indicate the active page.

2. **Course Table**:
   - The homepage (`index.html`) displays a table that lists the courses being taken for the current semester.

3. **Graphic Links to Favorite Pages**:
   - Three favorite pages are linked at the bottom of the homepage using image-based links.

4. **Contact Form**:
   - `future1.html` contains a form that allows users to submit their name, email, and message.

## Pages

### 1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**:
- Displays a title "A site's navigational system".
- Contains a navigation bar linking to the homepage and two future pages.
- Shows a table of courses.
- Includes image links to three favorite external pages.

### 2. **Future Page 1 (`future1.html`)**:

- Contains a contact form with fields for name, email, and a message.

### 3. **Future Page 2 (`future2.html`)**:

## How to Use

1. **Navigation**:
   - You can navigate between the homepage and two future pages using the navigation bar at the top of each page.
   - The current page link is highlighted to indicate the active page.

2. **Table**:
   - The homepage contains a table listing courses taken this semester, with columns for course name, professor, and schedule.

3. **Favorite Links**:
   - At the bottom of the homepage, there are three image-based links to your favorite external websites. Replace `favorite1.jpg`, `favorite2.jpg`, and `favorite3.jpg` with actual image files.

4. **Form**:
   - On `future1.html`, a contact form allows users to submit their name, email, and a message. The form currently does not perform any back-end submission (action should be configured).
